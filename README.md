Machine Learning Final Assignment (COS30082 – Applied Machine Learning)

Developed a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Performed data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and applied scaling/encoding to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Built and compared multiple ML models such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

k-NN

Decision Trees

Evaluated models using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

Visualized model performance and dataset patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Selected the best-performing model and explained prediction behavior using feature importance & error analysis.

Documented the entire ML pipeline, results, and insights in a structured notebook.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Machine Learning Pipeline · Data Cleaning · EDA · Visualization · Model Evaluation
